# Empathetech.org

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) via 🍽️ [MJB Boilerplate](https://github.com/MollyJeanB/mjb-boilerplate).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

Node Version Manager (NVM) is recommended to maintain node version consistency with dependencies. If you don't already have NVM set up on your computer, use [this guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to get started. To specify the node version in the `.nvmrc` file:

```
nvm use
```

Then install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 4. Test and format

To run tests in watch mode:

```
yarn unit
```

And to run all tests once with coverage information:

```
yarn test
```

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. To format all files:

```
yarn format
```
